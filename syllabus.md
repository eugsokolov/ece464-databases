## ECE 464: Databases

#### Overview

“Engineering and design of databases. Topics to be covered may include: data models, database and scheme design; schema normalization and integrity constraints; query processing and optimization; distributed and parallel databases; SQL and XML.”


This course is designed to introduce students to the foundations of database systems, focusing on basics such as the relational algebra and data model, query optimization, query processing, and transactions. This is not a course solely on database design or SQL programming - though we will discuss these issues briefly.

#### Lectures

Lectures are held once a week, Tuesday 1800-2100. Attendance is not mandatory, but I strongly advise all students to attend every lecture. Lack of attendance will degrade performance in the class and more importantly degrade knowledge of databases.

I will not hold official office hours but I will be available for extra questions after lectures should the need arise. Students may reach me via email at any time and I will try my best to reply within 24 hours. Students may also post questions in the course Teams chat and I will try my best to reply within 24 hours (this is preferred as its quite likely other students have similar questions).

#### Prerequisites

Students should have taken ECE 264 (DSA 1) and ECE 365 (DSA 2). A background in software development and general knowledge of programming languages is assumed and will be further explored in this course. My preferred programming language is Python but students are welcome to explore with other programming languages.

#### Text

The course readings will primarily be drawn from the 3rd Edition of '[Database Management Systems](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/)' from Ramakrishnan and Gehrke.

In addition, the 5th Edition of '[Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)', edited by Stonebraker and Hellerstein.

#### Grading

The breakdown is as follows:

- Final Project: 40%

- Final Exam: 30%

- Problem Sets: 3x10%

Grading is to be followed by Cooper Union’s policy.

#### Collaboration Policy

For problem sets and paper readings, students are allowed to discuss answers with other students, but must write up their own answers and list collaborators. Simply copying solutions from other students is never allowed - see Cooper Union's official policy on plagarism. For the group project students will work in teams and hand in only one written report. *Note that I will know if students are copying or cheating.*
