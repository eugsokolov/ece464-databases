# Problem Set 3a Description

Students will write a project proposal researching various database designs and DBMSs, surveying them for a new project (or creating your own, new DBMS) that would revamp the internet. Read the paper "[Database Techniques for the World-Wide Web: A Survey](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~mpetropo/CSE705-FA08/pubs/webdb.pdf)" by Florescu et. al. The goal should be to convince me that a particular DBMS is best at solving the issues discussed in class and presented by Florescu et. al. with regards to internet data. Students can focus on a particular area or topic of interest, ie. taking the standpoint from Amazon or Google, the DoD, etc.

How would you describe, discuss, design, evaluate, and/or build:
* The problem and project at hand
* Pros and cons of different databases designs and DBMSs you propose using (whether SQL or NoSQL)
* Physical database design
* Manage and store the data (discuss the size of the data)
* Query/index evaluation, types of queries/indices you would use
* Scalability
* Robustness and recovery mechanisms

Comments regarding the write up:
* Individual work
* No page minimum, enough to get your point across. Pretend I am funding your project for a grant/startup - too little and I donâ€™t understand your premise, too much and I lose interest
* Citing papers, conference publications, talks, etc. is recommended and encouraged
