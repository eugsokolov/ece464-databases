# Problem Set 2 Description

### Web scraper

Create a web scraper from a preapproved site and store the data in a NoSQL database.


Datasets scraped should be "large". One should be able to ask the database a question about the scraped data, and receive an answer instantaneously.

Submissions should include two parts; the code to scrape the site, queries to the new data


Example pages may include (but are not limited to):

### Writeup
Rough overview of the code/files

What is your approach to scraping the site? Show some example urls and describe the rough flow.

Data storage: What is the schema of your data? How do you query it.

Results: Show some interesting queries/results. Visualizations/charts are great if possible.
